## Building

You will need to download [SHFB](https://github.com/EWSoftware/SHFB/releases) in order to build this project.

To build, you will need to add the "Tridion.Web.UI.Core.dll" DLL to the ProjectReferences folder (DLL not included in repository due to license restrictions). After that, just right click on the project and build like you would any other project.

A Web Site project has been added to the Visual Studio Solution that just points to the Help folder... this folder is automatically generated by the SHFB project.  You can just right click on "index.html" from the Help Web Site project and *"View In Browser"*.
